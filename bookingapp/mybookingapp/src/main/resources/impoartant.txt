**** very important point ***********
1️⃣ One Git repo contains all apps (chat, booking, mcommerce).
2️⃣ Each app lives in its own folder; code is written only once.
3️⃣ Versions are handled by Git branches, not by copying folders.
4️⃣ A branch changes only the relevant app folder; others remain untouched.
5️⃣ Git stores only differences, so there is no duplicate code
